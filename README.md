## Advice: 
- Get to know AI, Bing, ChatGPT, the conversation is the key to success, not the question asked
- Ansible Automation Platform is quite useful, very quick to learn if you know Python
- AI is amazing at discussing a problem..I daily get answers that grow my understanding of DevSecOps skills
- Azure is actually a DevSecOps dream for me, Azure CLI is so powerful, I do quite a lot of discovery in the CLI
- SQLDB is quite easy to interact with in Python using pyodbc, trusted connections are also easy to get working
- Microsoft Online Training is very helpful, take advantage and learn online as much as you can

## My Code explained
- datapump.py is a program to do export or import of a list of tables using Python callproc to DBMS_DATAPUMP. Some interesting things about it are that I use parallel, connect with an oracle wallet and am showing some real world usage. The expamples online I found were either one table or entire schema or full database etc. Often you want a list of tables and no metadata or table exist action etc. I am currently working on getting status from the job while running. In the meantime when I do this in my code I loop in a query of dbms_datapump_jobs for state of not NOT RUNNING [ i.e. executing or other processing ]. Then returning to my code as the job has completed or error'd out.
