## Free Gold, Invest in this knowledge it has value that grows over time
- setup immediately an Oracle wallet and use it inside your scripts and Python. No more username/password, now /@[wallet_key], i.e. cx_Oracle.connect("/@ahost:1521/aservice") will get you in.
- Use EZConnect and free yourself from tnsnames.ora. Put the EZConnect strings as your wallet keys, i.e. mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential ahost:12521/aservice userxyz "the#passw0rd" 
- If you have special chars in the password use double quotes around the password [ see above use ]
- If you open cursors, close them, if you open a database connection, close it. Be a good client don't waste DB resources
- AskTom is an Oracle Savant, I add "AskTom" to all my searches and go first to his answers. Do yourself a favor and do the same, trust me.
